## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size (working on mobile ver)
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made
- For easier navigation I made the first nav link clickable for now

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS custom properties
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- React router
- React form library

### What I learned

- Better understanding on form validation
- Logic behind multi step forms (that a simple form can be surprisingly complicated!)

### Continued development

I'm still working on mobile version of this form. There are some bugs related to pricing selection and final confirmation, I will fix them soon!


### Useful resources

- react router is great!
- react hook form is very fun to use
- I will keep on learning!!
